/* In style, border-style: none will return 0 height; Thus, you can't see anything on your website. 
You need to specify height to be able to see the border. right now in current code, border-style is dotted none none (total 3 parts).
this is the order of 'top | left and right | bottom', so we left top border only. 

    In hr, width: 30% means no matter your browser size is, it is always 30% of width of the page.*/

/* STYLE PRACTICE: 1) When you put property, put it in alphabetical order so that you can debug easily when there is a problem.
                   2) One {property:value} pair per line */
